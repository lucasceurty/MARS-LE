# MARS
MARS (official) MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator

 MARS is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language, intended for educational-level use with Patterson and Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design.
 MARS was developed by Pete Sanderson and Ken Vollmar and can be found at https://dpetersanderson.github.io/.

 This fork of MARS is a research project undertaken by John Edelman, Jun Law, and Dominic Dabish in summer 2025, aiming to modernize MARS and specifically to enable students to specify their own custom assembly languages for use with the MARS simulator.


 # MY PROJECT README (Football Assembly)
 My files that I added to the customlang folder are FootballAssembly.java and FootballAssembly.jar.
 Once compiled in terminal, it works through language switcher on the Mars.jar simulation.
 My example asm file is football.asm which can be ran after switching the language to Football Assembly.

 The following instructions are implemented: 
set
ran
catch
run
tackle
sprint
relax playing style
stiffarm
ad break
intercept
fumble
touchdown
extra point
safety
field goal
hailmary attempt
sack
flag
two point conversion attempt
celebration
playcall
forfeit
